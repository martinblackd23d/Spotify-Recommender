Martin Black, Torri Presler, Tracey Treat

ICS 372

The Spotify Song Recommender is a Java program that, when given a seed (for example, another song), uses the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to generate personalized song recommendations. These recommendations are then saved as a new playlist. 

# Running the project

```./gradlew run```

Press Login button

When the browser prompts, log into your Spotify account

# Current functionality
1. The program starts and displays the main UI
2. If the Login button is pressed it prompts the user to log in
3. Once the user is logged in, it generates a playlist from a hardcoded source song
4. It saves the playlist into the user's library
5. It also displays the main UI with the playlist
